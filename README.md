# gintokki.art

Hi Gin! If you could do this for me:

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. Hopefully it'll ask you to sign into your GitHub account when you open that program...
1. In GitHub desktop: `File` > `Clone repository...` and find `takaia/gintokki.art` in the list. Click it, tell it what directory on your computer you want to put it in, and then click `Clone`
1. Unzip the file I sent you into the direcory you chose above and delete the .zip file
1. In GitHub desktop: put a comment in the spot where it says to and click the `Commit to main` button
1. Click the `Push Origin` button
